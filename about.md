  Hey there! Welcome to my personal blog. Here I will be curating interesting ideas that I hope you enjoy it.
</p>

##Here is my story

I got an Honours degree in Mathematics from the ANU. I went there to study the Bachelor of Philosophy degree with the intention studying Physics and then doing a PhD after. I eventually found myself taking more and more Mathematics subjects and falling in love with the field, however, I found myself getting into areas that I felt were a bit disconnected with reality.

As a result, I jumped into the business world securing a job with [Nous Group](http://www.nousgroup.com/au/), a leading Australian management consulting firm. Whilst I enjoyed my time there and worked with some incredible people, I found that the focus on public policy was not for me and I decided to take a well deserved break.

Packing up in December 2013, I travelled through Australia visiting friends and family for 4 months and then finally setting off to South East Asia. I travelled for about 6 months through Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Laos. I subsequently rented a place in Hanoi and lived there for about 9 months working online, studying Vietnamese and picking other skills such as motorcycle repairs and R programming.

I returned to Australia with the hope of starting a new business in Adelaide. After working on it for 2 months, my business partner and I decided that it would be better to turn this into a hobby rather than a full time venture so that we can pursue our respective passions. 

For me, that passion is understanding the complex issues facing our society. I am currently building my skills in working with the huge data sets that are being produced on a daily basis. This blog is focused sharing my interests in this area.
