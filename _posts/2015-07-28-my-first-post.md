I have a range of blogs that I had set up in Wordpress with about 1 or 2 posts on them and I wanted to put together a blog that I could use to explore and share my work as a data scientist. The only problem was that whilst Wordpress worked for my text blogs, it wasn’t enough to do mathematics on it. After a quick search I found this article by [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) who uses jekyll, github pages, and poole. He provides a pretty good tutorial for setting it up. However, I’m not hugely familiar with these tools and so this tutorial will help those who aren’t incredibly familiar with github or found they needed more help breaking down what Joshua wrote. 

They say to install jekyll first using the command:

$ gem install jekyll

Then you have to physically download the files



Thanks!
