title: If words could kill - GeoNext Hackfest 2015 Entry
---

*Disclaimer: This post discusses road fatalities in a light humour. This is just one creative, albeit morbid, way that we can play with some of the latest geospatial technology and data. Some may find it distasteful. It also intentionally makes connections with things that in no way should be associated. Do not take these recommendations seriously.*

We’ve all heard the phrase, ‘words can kill’. But what if words could actually kill? And if so, what are the deadliest? 

For my GeoNext Hackfest 2015 entry, I decided to take a creative approach to answering this question. Using the new app [what3words](http://what3words.com/), which provides unique 3 word addresses to every 3m x 3m square on the planet. Combining this with the Crash Stats data that is made open by the [Victorian Government](https://www.data.vic.gov.au/data/dataset), we can now find out which are the deadliest words in Victoria.

Well the results are in, below is a wordle of the top 116 words to avoid:

Out of these, the top four deadliest words are: cried, latest, tent and verbs.

| Deadly Word  | Number of fatal accidents         | 
| :-------------: |:-------:|
| cried      | 6 | 
| latest     | 6      |  
| tent | 6|  
| verbs | 6

Some example of 3 word addresses with these dangerous words:

Given that the 3 word addresses are likely constructed after the accidents and are in no way related I think we don't have much to worry about. However, the superstitious among us might want to be a little wary when crossing certain 3m x 3m squares. I just hope latest.cried.tent isn't around my corner.

If you enjoyed this but would like to spend some time working with me on some more serious work. Feel free to get in touch and send me an email. I will be posting my code on GitHub shortly.

I highly recommend checking out [what3words](http://what3words.com/). Not only is it a fun way to locate your business but also incredibly useful, particularly if the 3 word location is a little hard to find using your usual street address.
